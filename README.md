# Lumen Proxy Pass
Composer package for Lumen that resolves the correct absolute URLs when behind a proxy

This package is built for version 5.0 of Lumen and above. It modifies the functionality
of the `url()`, `asset()`, and other helper methods.

To install from Composer, use the following command:

```
composer require csun-metalab/lumen-proxypass
```

## Installation

First, add the following lines to your .env file to leverage the proxy attributes:

```
PROXY_ACTIVE=true
PROXY_PATH_HEADER=HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PATH
```

You may also add the following optional lines to your .env file to leverage the ability to FORCE the URL and schema without having to pass through a load balancer or proxy:

```
# http or https: PUBLIC_SCHEMA_OVERRIDE=https
PUBLIC_SCHEMA_OVERRIDE=

# Example: PUBLIC_URL_OVERRIDE=http://some-other-domain.example.com/some-other-directory
PUBLIC_URL_OVERRIDE=
```

Next, register the service provider in `bootstrap/app.php` as follows:

```
$app->register(CSUNMetaLab\LumenProxyPass\Providers\ProxyPassServiceProvider::class);
```

### Configuration File

If you do not already have a `config` directory in your project root, go ahead and create it.

In order to leverage the custom configuration values from this package, copy and paste the following code into a file called `proxypass.php` within your `config` directory in Lumen:

```
<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Proxy Active?
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Determines whether the rewriting of the URLs is active. Default is true.
    |
    */
    'proxy_active' => env("PROXY_ACTIVE", true),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Public Absolute URL Override
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Overrides the root of the path generated by various methods to be the value
    | specified here when resolving the "public" directory. Methods include
    | asset(), url(), etc.
    |
    | I.E. A value of "http://localhost/someotherpath/public" would make the
    | methods start with "http://localhost/someotherpath/public" instead
    | of the typical "http://[domain]/[application path]/public" prefix.
    |
    */
    'public_url_override' => env("PUBLIC_URL_OVERRIDE", ""),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Public URL Schema Override
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Overrides the schema (http|https) that will be prefixed to all URLs.
    |
    */
    'public_schema_override' => env("PUBLIC_SCHEMA_OVERRIDE", ""),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Proxied Path Header
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The PHP-transformed name of the header that is passing along the rewritten
    | base URL from the proxy. Defaults to "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PATH".
    |
    */
    'proxy_path_header' => env("PROXY_PATH_HEADER", "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PATH"),

];

?>

```

## Environment Variables

The two environment variables you added to your .env file are the following:

### PROXY_ACTIVE

Set this to `true` to enable the proxying functionality or `false` to disable it.

### PROXY_PATH_HEADER

This is the PHP-interpreted value of the request header sent from your proxy. The
default is `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PATH` (the computed value of `X-Forwarded-Path`)

## Usage Example

Let's say you have an API hosted at `http://lumen.example.com` but that is
not the location you want to show to the world. Instead, you want to show a URL of
`http://www.example.com/lumen` so you place your Lumen API behind a proxy.

However, you notice that while the front page loads properly, none of the URLs you
have written with the `url()`, `asset()`, or other helpers work with that URL and instead
continue writing `http://lumen.example.com` as their base path.

You can configure your proxy to add a request header along with your `ProxyPass` and
`ProxyPassReverse` directives in Apache (ensure you have `mod_headers` enabled and
`mod_proxy` enabled as well):

```
ProxyPass        /lumen http://lumen.example.com
ProxyPassReverse /lumen http://lumen.example.com

<Location /lumen>
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Path "http://www.example.com/lumen"
</Location>
```

Now all of your URLs using the `url()`, `asset()`, and other helpers will be written
correctly!
